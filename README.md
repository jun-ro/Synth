## Features

- Plugin support system.
- Animation bundler
- RemoteEvent handling.
- Lightweight


## Why Synth?

For me at least, "Synth" provides a more native feel when it comes to developing on roblox with a framework. Unlike the usual design pattern in Knit, Synth is flexible and allows developers to create scripts anywhere and still utilize the full capability of the framework.
